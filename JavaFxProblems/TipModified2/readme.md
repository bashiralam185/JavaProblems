<h2> Tip Calculator App - Modified</h2> 

<h3> Description </h3>
The Tip Calculator app from Section 12.5 does not need a Button to perform its calculations. Re-implement this app to use property listeners to perform the calculations whenever the user modifies the bill amount or changes the custom tip percentage. Also use a property binding to update the Label that displays the tip percentage.

<h3> Software </h3>
<h4>JavaFX SDK 11.0.2 -<br>
Scene Builder 11.0.0 -<br>
IntelliJ IDEA - <br>
